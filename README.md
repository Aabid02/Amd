Hashing is processed using key values into a range of indexes of an array.
Hash table is used to implement the map interface and extends dictionary class.
Hash Key = Key Value % Number of slots in table.
Linear Probing is used for resolving collisions in hash table. Formula is P = (1 + P) % (MOD) table_size.
Applications of Hash table are applied where constant time lookup and insertion is required, cryptographic applications, indexing data.
